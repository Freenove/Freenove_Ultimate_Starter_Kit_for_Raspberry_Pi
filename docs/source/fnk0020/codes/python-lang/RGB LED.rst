In this chapter, we will learn how to control a RGB LED.

An RGB LED has 3 LEDs integrated into one LED component. It can respectively emit Red, Green and Blue light. In order to do this, it requires 4 pins (this is also how you identify it). The long pin (1) is the common which is the Anode (+) or positive lead, the other 3 are the Cathodes (-) or negative leads. A rendering of a RGB LED and its electronic symbol are shown below. We can make RGB LED emit various colors of light and brightness by controlling the 3 Cathodes (2, 3 & 4) of the RGB LED

Red, Green, and Blue light are called 3 Primary Colors when discussing light (Note: for pigments such as paints, the 3 Primary Colors are Red, Blue and Yellow). When you combine these three Primary Colors of light with varied brightness, they can produce almost any color of visible light. Computer screens, single pixels of cell phone screens, neon lamps, etc. can all produce millions of colors due to phenomenon.

If we use a three 8 bit PWM to control the RGB LED, in theory, we can create 28*28*28=16777216 (16 million) colors through different combinations of RGB light brightness.

Next, we will use RGB LED to make a multicolored LED.

.. note:: 
    In this kit, the RGB led is Common anode. The voltage difference between LED will make it work. There is no visible GND. The GPIO ports can also receive current while in output mode.If circuit above doesn’t work, the RGB LED may be common cathode. Please try following wiring.There is no need to modify code for random color.

Code
================================================================

We need to use RGBLED class to control RGBLED. The parameters for setting the RGBLED as common cathode or common anode are provided in the RGBLED class. You can set it according to the type of your RGB LED, and the default setting in our example code is based on common anode.

Python Code 5.1.1 ColorfulLED
----------------------------------------------------------------

First, observe the project result, and then learn about the code in detail.

.. hint:: 
    :red:`If you have any concerns, please contact us via:`  support@freenove.com

1.	Use cd command to enter 05.1.1_ColorfulLED directory of Python code.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/Freenove_Kit/Code/Python_GPIOZero_Code/05.1.1_ColorfulLED

2.	Use python command to execute python code “ColorfulLED.py”.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python ColorfulLED.py

After the program is executed, you will see that the RGB LED randomly lights up different colors.

The following is the program code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Code/Python_GPIOZero_Code/05.1.1_ColorfulLED/ColorfulLED.py
    :linenos: 
    :language: python

Import the RGBLED class that controls RGBLED from the gpiozero library.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from gpiozero import RGBLED

Create the RGBLED class for controlling the RGBLED.

.. code-block:: python
    
    led = RGBLED(red=17, green=18, blue=27, active_high=False) # define the pins for R:GPIO17,G:GPIO18,B:GPIO2

In the previous chapter, we learned how to make a pin output PWM using the Python language. In this project, we output to three pins via PWM. In the "while" loop of the "loop" function, we first generate three random numbers and then assign these three random numbers to the PWM values of the three pins, which will make the RGB LED randomly produce multiple colors.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Code/Python_GPIOZero_Code/05.1.1_ColorfulLED/ColorfulLED.py
    :linenos: 
    :language: python
    :lines: 21-28
