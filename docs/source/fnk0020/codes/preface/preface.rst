Raspberry Pi is a low cost, **credit card sized computer** that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. 
It is an incredibly capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, 
and to learn how to program in a variety of computer languages like Scratch and Python. 
It is capable of doing everything you would expect from a desktop computer, such as browsing the internet, 
playing high-definition video content, creating spreadsheets, performing word-processing, 
and playing video games. For more information, you can refer to `Raspberry Pi official website <https://www.raspbrrypi.com>`_. 
For clarification, this tutorial will also reference Raspberry Pi as RPi, RPI and RasPi.

In this tutorial, most chapters consist of Components List, **Component Knowledge, Circuit, and Code**. We provide C code for each project in this tutorial. After completing this tutorial, you can learn Java by reading Processing.pdf.

This kit does not contain :doc:`Raspberry and its accessories <./install-system Required Components>`. You can also use the components and modules in this kit to create projects of your own design.
