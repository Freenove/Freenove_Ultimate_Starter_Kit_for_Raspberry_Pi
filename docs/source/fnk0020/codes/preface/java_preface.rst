Preface
##############################################################################

Raspberry Pi is a low cost, **credit card sized computer** that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. 
It is an incredibly capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, 
and to learn how to program in a variety of computer languages like Scratch and Python. 
It is capable of doing everything you would expect from a desktop computer, such as browsing the internet, 
playing high-definition video content, creating spreadsheets, performing word-processing, 
and playing video games. For more information, you can refer to `Raspberry Pi official website <https://www.raspbrrypi.com>`_. 
For clarification, this tutorial will also reference Raspberry Pi as RPi, RPI and RasPi.

In this tutorial, most chapters consist of Components List, **Component Knowledge, Circuit, and Code**. We provide C code for each project in this tutorial. After completing this tutorial, you can learn Java by reading Processing.pdf.

This kit does not contain :doc:`Raspberry and its accessories <./install-system Required Components>`. You can also use the components and modules in this kit to create projects of your own design.

Raspberry Pi
##############################################################################

So far, at this writing, Raspberry Pi has advanced to its fifth generation product offering. Version changes are accompanied by increases in upgrades in hardware and capabilities. 

The A type and B type versions of the first generation products have been discontinued due to various reasons. What is most important is that other popular and currently available versions are consistent in the order and number of pins and their assigned designation of function, making compatibility of peripheral devices greatly enhanced between versions.

Below are the raspberry pi pictures and model pictures supported by this product. They have 40 pins.

In addition, RPi also needs an Ethernet network cable used to connect it to a WAN (Wide Area Network).

The Raspberry Pi 5 provides 1.6A of power to downstream USB peripherals when connected to a power supply capable of 5A at +5V (25W). When connected to any other compatible power supply, the Raspberry Pi 5 restricts downstream USB devices to 600mA of power.

Optional Components
****************************************************************

Under normal circumstances, there are two ways to login to Raspberry Pi: 

1) Using a stand-alone monitor. 
2) Using a remote desktop or laptop computer monitor âsharingâ the PC monitor with your RPi.

Required Accessories for Monitor
================================================================

If you choose to use an independent monitor, mouse and keyboard, you also need the following accessories:
1. A display with a HDMI interface
2. A Mouse and a Keyboard with an USB interface

As to Pi Zero and Pi Zero W, you also need the following accessories:
1.	A Mini-HDMI to HDMI Adapter and Cable.
2.	A Micro-USB to USB-A Adapter and Cable (Micro USB OTG Cable). 
3.	A USB HUB.
4.	USB to Ethernet Interface or USB Wi-Fi receiver. 

For different Raspberry Pi Modules, the optional items may vary slightly but they all aim to convert the interfaces to Raspberry Pi standards.
